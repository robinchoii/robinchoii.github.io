          <h3>Final Review</h3>
           <p>Well let me first say it has been an awesome first 9 weeks of Dev Bootcamp.  I really enjoyed phase 0 because everything we learned was simple enough to learn the basics and hopefully when we go on the site, we will dig deeper into topics.  Finally I have my website somewhat runnning and functioning the way I like.  Building a website was very fun because I got to create exactly what I wanted and where to put them.  However I did run into a lot of problems because it was hard to position everything exactly where I wanted them. CSS was also fun but difficult at times.  I had to do a lot of research to make sure I wanted my website look the way I wanted to. We just got into a little bit of jQuery this week and I noticed some of the animation were easily done there.  Unfortunately I did not get the chance to add any animations to my website, that is what I will be doing next!.</p>
