          <h3>Better Safe than Sorry!</h3>
          <p>The tech industry is getting bigger and bigger every blink of an eye. We have been so dependent on the Internet, I mean who isn't? What do you do if you do know an answer to something? That's right, you Google it. In order to access this data, we need to pass a security system.  One of the main problems in the tech world is security.  There are millions of companies, small or large, whom have so much data stored online whether it is a server or cloud.  All this data is being asked for me to get into via non-authorized people. Cyber-attacks are bigger then ever before because the tech world is very vulnerable. Just recently, Ashley Madison, the dating website, hackers stole millions and users' private information such as, names, photos, sexually explicit chat logs, and credit card information. Also, eight institutions were cyber attacked in New Jersey.  Schools like Rutgers is paying big money for their systems not to get hacked again, which has happened four times in one year.  You get the picture. Security should be a main concern for everybody.  Unfortunately, I believe cyber attacks are inevitable because security systems cannot keep up to the coders all over the world. We need to make sure our systems are update date at all times.
