        <h2>Enumerable Method</h2>
          <p>What is an enumerable? The past few weeks I was having a hard time putting my head around this word and still my struggle to define it to the dot.  After doing some research, I came to conclusion that an enumerable is a module that holds together a package of different methods. Hence, you don't have to keep on writing methods when working with different arrays or hashes.  Enumerables allows you to look at every element and do something with them.  This can be very useful in arrays or hashes. Today I want to talk about the enumerable method, group_by.  Image if you have all this information and you want to group them into categories. For instance, I want to know what my friend's favorite sport is. <img src="https://github.com/robinchoii/robinchoii.github.io/blob/master/blog/group_by.png?raw=true" alt="group_by" /> We can also use them in arrays. For example, I want to a list of names by how many characters each name has. <img src="https://github.com/robinchoii/robinchoii.github.io/blob/master/blog/names.png?raw=true" alt="names" />
