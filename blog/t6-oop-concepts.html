Scoping can be very difficult to understand still may be hard to get your head around it.  I read a good resource from my GPS guide and it make a lot of sense to me.  First, when you think of scope, think of two words: variables and visibility.  If you look into a telescope, what you see is what you see at that moment.  If you turn move the telescope around you can see different things.   Variable scope is pretty similar actually.  There are different types of scopes, Class variable, Instance variable, Global, variable, and Local variable. We will start with Global variable. Having a global variable allows you to access that variable wherever and whenever you want to in your code.  Seems like thats what you want for everything right?  Actually, this can be vary dangerous because it can be access by anyone and you wouldn't know who. So a Global variable will be available everywhere in your Ruby script.   Class variables narrows it down a little bit.  Class variables are available to anywhere within the class.  I cannot access a method inside the class variable unless I am inside the class.  Deeper we go, we have an Instance variable which is only available to a specific object.  You can have many methods with in a class across all methods.  Finally Local variable will depend on what scope you are in.
