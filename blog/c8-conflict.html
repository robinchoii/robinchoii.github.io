          <h3>CONFLICTS</h3>
          <article>
            <h4>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
              <p>Conflicts are inevitable so whenever I run into conflicts, I always try to find a solution to the conflict. The most recent conflict I had was with my roommate.  We share a lot of the household items and food. However I always seems to be getting the short end of the stick.  I always seems to be the one going out of my way to replace or get more of something.  </p>

            <h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
            <p>The source of this conflict is probably lack of communication which is actually the source for a lot of conflicts.  </p>

          <article>
            <h4>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h4>
            <p>I felt very annoyed because something I just would think it is common sense and I shouldn't have to explain everything.  </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
            <p>I would probably make a list or chart of the community things we use and switch off buying those items rather than assuming someone will get it.  And maybe even separate our foods. </p>

          <article>
            <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
            <p>I learned that communication is very important, in almost anything. I need to be on the right page with someone from the beginning so I know where they are coming from. </p>
