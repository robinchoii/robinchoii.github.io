          <p>JavaScript and Ruby are two different languages, but they are also similar.  Ruby has a lot of shortcuts and simple ways to write code.  JavaScipt seems to be a little bit more detailed.  Iteration seems be used a lot in ruby but when I starting to learn JavaScript, I couldn't find how to do that. I then did some research and found out iterations can be done in Javascript, loops. When iterating, you have a state which is the current state of the variable you want to iterate. Then there is a condition, under what condiditon do you want to interate you variable ( you dont have an infinite loops) Lastly, the iterator, how does the state change once you iterate it.
          <br>
          ** Javascript **<br>
          for(var x = 1, x < 11, x++) {<br>
            console.log(x+5); <br>
          }
          <br>
          var x = 1 is the state(starting value), x < 10 is the condition(iterate until x is less than 11, and x++ is the iterator(adds 1 to x after each iteration). Will then add 5 to each x and give the new value.
          <br><br>
          ** Ruby **<br>
          10.times do |x|<br>
            puts (x+1)+5<br>
          end<br>
          <br>
          Both will return 5,6,7.. 15
