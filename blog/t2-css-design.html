        <h3>Margin vs Border vs Padding</h3>
          <p>Margin, border, and padding are all very important to CSS.  Think of three layers, the most outer layer being margin, then border, then padding.  The margin make up the space around your element, vertically or horizontally.  Think of it like a word document.  The texts doesn't start at the edge of the page, there is a margin (or space) between the edge and text. Imagine putting a small box into and bigger box.  All the space between the boxes would be your margin. The border is what goes around your text, you can make it really thick, thin, or dashed. Padding is similar to margin but instead of the space outside the border, it is the space between your text and your border (if you have a border).
