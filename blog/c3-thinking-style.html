          <h3>Let's Think!</h3>
          <p>After retaking the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz, I know for sure I am not an Abstract Sequential Thinker. I tied the rest, Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, and Abstract Random. Actually Concrete Random had one for vote than Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random. Looking over what I like and how I learn according to the description, I'd say it pretty accurate. I like taking risks and experimenting to find out answer. I do not like when answers and just shown to me and if they given to me, I'll use that to keep experimenting until I get the answer myself to make sure I am correct.  Although answer aren't given to me throughout phase 0, I like to use my intuition to find my answers.  I noticed this week 2 and week 3 have been a lot of trial and error but like I said in previous reflection that is what I like and how I learn which perfectly fits the description of a Concrete Random.
          </p>
          <p>Sometimes I can go too deep in my rabbit hole before realizing it. Again this matches my type of thinking, it is hard for me to keep restrictions and limitations.  I do plan on keeping an eye out to not work on one thing until I figure it out straight but there time box and give my brain a break and then resume.  I love challenges because of my whole life I have been a competitive athlete.  Nothing feels better than overcoming my challenges.  Therefore my time in phase 0 and DBC as a whole, I believe I will succeed. When I hit a wall, I do not like to sit and cry about it.  I use that as a leverage and motivation to overcome that wall. Having growth mindset over a fixed mindset will give you that edge when being compared to others.  To me, having a fixed mindset seems like settling for something.  When you settle you never take full advantage of your opportunity.  DBC is my life for the next few months and I am going take full advantage of it. For example, I will try to go beyond the minimum requirements like peer pairings and feedback.  Three weeks in, I realized I need push myself more and get out of my comfort zone. Going over learning and thinking style was a great plus, I redirect my thinking and learning to be a more growth mindset and alter my weaknesses into strengths.
