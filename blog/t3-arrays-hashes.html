        <h3>Arrays vs Hashes</h3>
          <p>This week was an awesome week because we got to dive into Ruby.  Right off the bat we started learning methods, variables, arrays, and hashes.  I want to talk about arrays because they are very important.  You can think an array like a storage box for your personal items. For example, you can store sports equipment, musical instruments, or anything tangible.  There is one catch though, unlike counting from 1 in your storage box, an array starts from 0. You can store integers or strings in your array and then calling them buy array[0] (for your first object because remember 0 is first not 1.) Your list in your array can be accessed by index. Each element in your array is assigned an index which basically what I mentioned before name_of_array["x"]. The first index is 0, then 1, then 2, you get the point. So array = ["robin", "seattle", 23]. "robin" is index 0, "seattle" is index "1", and 23 is index "2". Notice how 23 is not in quotes because then it would be a string not an integer. Now we know what an array is, a list of items in order starting from index 0. You can also learn more about arrays <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">Here</a>.

          </p>
          <p>Lets say we want to store something without assigning an index to it. In other words, what if we do not want to use numbers to list them at all? Meet hashes.  A hash is similar to an array but instead of having indexes, it has key-value pairs.  What i mean by key-value pairs is assigning an value to a key.  For example, lets say I have the hash "ages".  Under my hash which is surrounded by curly braces {} open and close respectively, I have "Robin" => 23. "Andrew" => 27. Each key-value pair go under the previous one and is separated by a comma. You can learn more about hashes <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.htmljj">Here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Arrays and Hashes are great tools to store information. Just remember arrays are ordered and hashes are not. Hashes have key-value pairs and arrays have an index. You can think of hashes like a data structure, that hold information about certain key values. All in all use arrays and hash to store items or key pairs.
