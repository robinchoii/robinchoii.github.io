      Version control keeps track of files that you have changed over time.  In other words, you won’t lose your work by accidentally deleting it.  Version control comes with many benefits.  One of the main benefits is being able to work with multiple people on the same project at the same time, without stepping on each other’s shoes. Everyone can contribute to project individually and then version control allows you to merge the changes in a common version.  Three minds are better than one. Version control also allows you to store your work for you to come back and look at whenever you like.  You can also restore older versions of a file and go back in time to them and undo/add to your file.  Whenever you save your new version, version control will let you see exactly what you changed in the file.

        Git is a version control system.  Whenever you change a file on git, it tracks that you changed it.  You can check this by using ‘git status.’ Once you changed something, you must add the file you tracked and then commit.  Committing is like saving. This allows you to go back to your file whenever you like. You can also use branches to so that you don't over write any changes you made.  You now have separate files of the same file you altered.

        We use Github to store our code because we want other people to look at our code.  They can look at it, change it, and send their changes back to you.  Github is a wonderful place for all the developers to help each other out.  You can even use Github to store your file privately or publicly and you can have as many as you want.  Github is a great way to communicate with other developers to improve code or even to debug a code.
