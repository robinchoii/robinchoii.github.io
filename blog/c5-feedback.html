        <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>Sometimes I like to work alone, but I like to work with someone else more!  Especially because we are all new to coding (well maybe not all) I like how we can communicate through each challenge.  Working with a partner allows you to approach the problem in different angles because we think differently. Besides, two minds is better than one right?  Sometimes I might not know the next time and it is nice to know that my partner might lead me in the right direction.  All my pairs have been great and enjoy working them.  Let's be honest, it fun when our code works and we finish the challenge, it feels like an accomplishment.  Frustrating is probably the wrong way to phrase this, but sometimes I feel like I don't bring enough to the table which is discouraging to me because I want to contribute. Hopefully my partner does not thing bad of me.  From what I can tell the people here are great and don't judge you for not knowing and are always willing to help.
          </p>
          <p>For the most part, I felt really good and positive about the feed back I received. They made me feel like I am learning more than I think I am. The feedback was very helpful, whatever my lowest rating was I try to do more of that in my next pair. Based on my feedback, it seems like I need to work on driving more. Although I thought I was driving pretty well, there is always room for improvement.  Writing feedback to others was good because it goes over the whole pairing session double thinking about my contributions and what I learned out of it.  What is difficult for me when writing feedback is actionable feedback.  It's been easy to write kind and specific feedback but most of my actionable feedback has been the same and I am trying to figure out other ways to write it.
          </p>
          <p>Over all writing feedback is great and I totally understand why DBC focuses so much on it. Getting different opinions from other people can make me a better learner. You can almost use it as a gage to see how you are doing.
