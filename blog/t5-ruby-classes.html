        <h2>My first blog!</h2>
          <p>I've been learning a lot of ruby the past two weeks from arrays, hashes, and enumerables.  This week we went a little deeper and discovered classes.  Classes take strings, integers, methods, and floats and groups them into one so that you dont have to rewrite each string or method.  Making a class is like a shortcut for you to write less code and it also keesp your code more organized.  For example, let's say you are a teacher and you need to enter your students information. You can create a class called Students.

class Students
  def initialize(name, city, age)
        @name = name
        @city = city
        @age = age
    end
end

Anthing with "@" infront of it is called an instance variable. We can use those instance variables in other methods.

class Students
    def initialize(name, city, age)
        @name = name
        @city = city
        @age = age
    end

    def greetings
        "Hello! My name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old. I am from #{@city}, the best city in the world!"
    end

end


robin = Students.new("Robin", "Seattle", 23)
p robin.greetings
  "Hello! My name is Robin and I am 23 years old. I am from Seattle, the best city in the world!"

We can create new objects now with the Student class.
