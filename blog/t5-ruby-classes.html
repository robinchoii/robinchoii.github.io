        <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
          <p>I've been learning a lot of ruby the past two weeks from arrays, hashes, and enumerables.  This week we went a little deeper and discovered classes.  Classes take strings, integers, methods, and floats and groups them into one so that you dont have to rewrite each string or method.  Making a class is like a shortcut for you to write less code and it also keesp your code more organized.  For example, let's say you are a teacher and you need to enter your students information. You can create a class called Students.<br><br>

class Students<br>
  def initialize(name, city, age)<br>
        @name = name<br>
        @city = city<br>
        @age = age<br>
    end<br>
end<br>
<br>
Anthing with "@" infront of it is called an instance variable. We can use those instance variables in other methods.<br>
<br>
class Students<br>
    def initialize(name, city, age)<br>
        @name = name<br>
        @city = city<br>
        @age = age<br>
    end<br>
<br>
    def greetings<br>
        "Hello! My name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old. I am from #{@city}, the best city in the world!"
    end<br>
end<br>
<br>
<br>
robin = Students.new("Robin", "Seattle", 23)<br>
p robin.greetings<br>
  "Hello! My name is Robin and I am 23 years old. I am from Seattle, the best city in the world!"<br>
<br>
We can create new objects now with the Student class.<br>
