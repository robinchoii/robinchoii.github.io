          <h3>Friends and Family</h3>
          <p>I have always valued my friends and family the most.  I can always rely on them in the darkest or brightest times.  Creating and building strong friendships has helped me be a better person and stay positive.  The last topic someone asked for advice was a relationship question. I tried to explain what I would do in their situation. I feel great when I think about my friends and family. Because I have been away from them for some time, I value them even more. However, I still keep in touch with them even though I moved away.  My friendships will guide me away from stereotype treat because I get happy when thinking about all the memories I made with my friends. Whenever I am down, I can go to my friends and explain whats going wrong.  Being at DBC, I am excited to meet my new friends so I can share my thoughts with them when needed.
