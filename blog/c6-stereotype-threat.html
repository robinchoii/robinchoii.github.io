          <h3>Stereotypes</h3>
          <p>What is stereotype threat? Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group.  What the heck does that mean? Let me give you an example.  Growing up in an asian culture, my parents grilled me to study all day everyday.  Was I smarter than people who didn't study as much as I did? Not at all. Going to school, students would think "Oh the asians are smart, they study a lot"  I felt the pressure that I needed to know the answer or else people would think I wasn't smart or something like that.  It does bother me because who doesnt want to live up to their hype?  What I realized today is no matter what you do, as long as you try you hardest, the results don't matter.  By the end of the day. you get what you put in, exactly what I am doing with DBC.
