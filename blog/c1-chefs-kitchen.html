      YThe video did an excellent job to identity the types of attitude coming into DBC.  Whether I am at work or school (K-post HS) I have always just gone, did my thing, and come back.  Iâ€™ve learned that in order to fully take advantage of my opportunity, I will have to do more than just going and coming back home.  Just like we need to come ready with an apron on to be ready to cook, taste, build, argument or anything that comes ready. I am ready to growth and connect with my cohort because we are all on the same boat.  I only expect what I put in. If I put in enough time and effort with my cohort, I will see results.  I believe Dev Bootcamp will be a great opportunity not only for myself but also for all the other students.  I can already tell how wonderful the community works together.  Being a competitive athlete, I am a strong believer in teamwork.

        I see myself engaging in with this type of culture pretty well.  It my be a little difficult to jumpstart because everyone is new and hasn't not met each other.  Once, I meet my colleagues in person (already have remote, some but not all), the transition on working together will be smoother.  My expectations remain somewhat the same. I thought I would only need 15-25 hours per week, however I am going a little overtime.  A lot of it was setting up and getting used to how things worked so maybe week 2 will be a little lighter.

        I am very exciting to be plugged into an environment where are here to learn together.  I understand if you surround yourself with people with similar goals and motivations, it will be easier to accomplish that goal.  Being around everyone will be the perfect environment for all of to learn and grow.  To be honest, I felt one of the two fears mentioned in the video.  I am completely new to this field and pretty much starting from scratch.  Knowing that many of the students are probably going through the same fear I feel less nervous and more confident about my time at DBC.
