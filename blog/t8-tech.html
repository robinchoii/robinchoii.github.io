        <h3>Active Record</h3>
          <p>It's funny how we just learned about SQL and accessed certain data from the database.  From the quick glance I looked at ActiveRecord, Active Record is like a shortcut to SQL. Similar to how Ruby has shortcuts and simpler than JavaScript.   With that said, ActiveRecord is referred to as an Object-Relational Mapping. For example, you can access one row in the database and map to object in Ruby. With ActiveRecord you can access and manipulate data stored in databases. Instead of going through all the SQL statements, you can use ActiveRecord attributes and methods to access and manipulate the data.
          </p>
          <p>Using an SQL statement, you'd compose an SQL query something like "SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1"
          </p>
          <p>Using ActiveRecord, that query now becomes something like p = Post.last
          </p>
