          <h3>Questions</h3>
           <p>Asking questions is very important especially when you do not know the answer to a question. There have been many times where I ask a very vague questions due to frustration.  Questions should be asked in a manner of detailed and what exactly you are looking for.  After going through everyones questions, most of them seemed to have been answered.  I liked the questions where there is a screen shot of their problem. This really narrows down the question to know what exactly is going on.  But sometimes we don't have access to screen shots and need to be very detailed in words. Similar to giving feedback that is kind, actionable, and specific; our questions should follow that rule. </p>
